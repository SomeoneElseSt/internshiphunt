# Internship Hunt w/Agno, Gemini, and AgentQL

What? A tool to help students navigate the transition from academia to the professional world by making internship applications more efficient and personalized.

## The Idea
Why? Our journey began as college freshmen struggling to translate academic skills into professional opportunities. We created Internship Hunt because we saw that our schoolmates were maximizing their chances of getting an internship by heavily leveraging AI, so we wondered how we could make this process as efficient and tailored as possible.

## The Product
This tool: 

- Builds an applicant's profile from their resume, and uses Gemini to ask personalized follow-up questions.
- Fetches any GitHub internship repository with a README.md file and uses another Gemini agent to match the applicant's profile to relevant internships in those repositories.
- These are then scanned with AgentQL to determine if they require a cover letter/research statement/why us statement. If yes, these are auto-generated by another Gemini agent, based on the applicant's profile up to that point.

## The Implementation
How? Thanks to awesome open-source tools and Sponsor API's at the MultiModal AI Agents Hackathon in San Francisco: 

- AgentQL
- Agno
- Streamlit
- Google Gemini
- Replit

## What's next â€” Feature Wish-List

- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
- Let user input their own API keys for AgentQL and Gemini.
- Let user input the GitHub Repo's they want analyzed.
