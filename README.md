# Internship Hunt w/Agno📚, Gemini🧠, and AgentQL🦾

**What?** A tool to help students navigate the transition from academia to the professional world by making internship applications more efficient and personalized leveraging AI at every step. 

See here: **https://internship-hunt.streamlit.app** 

## The Idea 💡
**Why?** Our journey began as college freshmen struggling to translate academic skills into professional opportunities. We created Internship Hunt because we saw that our schoolmates were maximizing their chances of getting an internship by heavily leveraging AI, so we wondered how we could make this process as efficient and tailored as possible using an Agenctic process with AI at every step.

## The Product 💻
This tool: 

- Builds an applicant's profile from their resume, and uses a Gemini agent to ask personalized follow-up questions.
- Fetches any GitHub internship repository with a README.md file and uses another Gemini agent to match the applicant's profile to relevant internships in those repositories.
- These are scanned with AgentQL to determine if they require a cover letter/research statement/why us statement.
- If yes, these requirements are auto-generated by another Gemini agent, based on the applicant's profile up to that point.

## The Implementation ⚙️
**How?** Thanks to awesome open-source tools and Sponsor API's at the MultiModal AI Agents Hackathon in San Francisco:
